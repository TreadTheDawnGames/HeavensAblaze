# Heavens Ablaze 
### Climb in your spacefigher and start shooting your friends!*

Heavens Ablaze it a peer to peer multiplayer physics based spaceship simulator. Made in six months with Unity 3D and [FishNet](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet) multiplayer library. Features include rebindable controls, customizable laser color (both of which persist between sessions), ship debris, dynamic speed reduction based on engine count, player tracker, and spacial sound.

### Personal Note

This was my first release ever. I learned a lot about coding, game design, the importance of project organization, and networking issues. Lots of networking issues. I made this game because there weren't any quality multiplayer spacefighter sims in my price range. The one I did have ([Starfighter Arduxim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/540500/Starfighter_Arduxim/)) didn't keep ship momentum, leading to a clunky experience. I didn't like that so I thought, "Hey, you could make your own. And if you did, you could make it any way you want!" Here's the result.

I have another project in the works (as of 7/26/2024), which will be available on itch.io when it is completed. The source code, however, can be viewed [here](https://github.com/SumRbrandR/MoonstruckTower). It is much better organized and coded than this. 😅

## Known Issues
Sometimes the room code claims it's invalid when it's not. Just restart the server and use the new code.

The damage hologram is sometimes inaccurate. Specifically when the supporting wing is destroyed. It displays missing body instead of just destroying that part.
